In Angular, the router is a powerful module that allows you to handle navigation and load different components based on the current URL and defined routes. The router provides capabilities to navigate from one view to the next as users perform tasks in your application.

Here are some fundamental concepts and features related to Angular's router:

1. **Routes and Configuration**:
    - Routes in Angular are defined using a configuration array, where each route is an object associating a URL path with a component.
      
2. **RouterOutlet**:
    - It's a directive provided by the router to mark the spot in the template where the router should display the components for that outlet.
      
3. **RouterLink**:
    - It's a directive you can use to bind clickable elements in your template to specific routes.
      
4. **Navigation**:
    - You can programmatically navigate using the `Router` service's `navigate` and `navigateByUrl` methods.
      
5. **Route Parameters**:
    - Routes can capture values in the URL to make routes dynamic. For instance, `/product/1` can map to a `ProductComponent` and pass the `1` as a parameter.
      
6. **Route Guards**:
    - Angular's router provides interfaces like `CanActivate`, `CanDeactivate`, and others that allow you
    
7. **Lazy Loading**:
	- This feature lets you split your application into multiple bundles which can be loaded on demand. It's particularly useful for large apps to ensure that users don't have to load the entire application to use a specific feature.
	  
8. **Resolver**:
	- Resolver's allow components to receive the necessary data before the route is finally activated. This is useful, for example, when you want to ensure data for a particular component is available before rendering it.
	  
9. **Child Routes**:
	- These allow for the configuration of more specific routes under a parent route, enabling the setup of intricate UI structures with nested views.

10. **Wildcard Routes**: 
	- This helps to capture and handle routes that don't match any of the defined paths, which can be useful for displaying a "404 - Not Found" page or redirecting to another route.
	  
11. **Route Animations**:
	- Angular's router allows you to define animations that get triggered as you navigate between routes. This lets you create more engaging user experiences.
	
12. **Auxiliary Routes**:
	- These are secondary routes that can have their own outlets and can be loaded alongside primary routes, allowing for complex UI designs with multiple views.
	
13. **Data and Resolve Properties**:
	- The router configuration lets you define data and resolve properties per route, allowing you to pass static data or fetch dynamic data for a route.

Integrating the router in an Angular application involves defining the routes, importing the `RouterModule`, and using router directives in templates. Combined, these tools and configurations provide a robust way to build single-page applications with rich navigation patterns.
