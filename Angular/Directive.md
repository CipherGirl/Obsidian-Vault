A directive is a class with a `@Directive()` (https://angular.io/api/core/Directive) decorator.
A component is technically a directive. However, components are so distinctive and central to Angular applications that Angular defines the `@Component()` decorator, which extends the `@Directive()` decorator with template-oriented features.
