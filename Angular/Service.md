Service is a broad category encompassing any value, function, or feature that an application needs. A service is typically a class with a narrow, well-defined purpose. A component is one type of class that can use DI.

Angular distinguishes components from services to increase modularity and reusability. By separating a component's view-related features from other kinds of processing, you can make your component classes lean and efficient.
